# ICMadness

As final project season approaches, you may feel the weight of coming up with a "big" "important" idea. This workshop is about doing the opposite: create a project based on [random instructions from a bot](https://itpnyu.github.io/ICMadness/). What can you do in 2 hours as a collaboration of three random ICM students with three random things (action, technology, topic) put together?
